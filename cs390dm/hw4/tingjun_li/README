    imports-85.data: original data
    randomselect.py: a file I used to generate random training set and testing set. it will call naive-bayes.py and regression-tree.py
    regression-tree.py: the code that implemented regression tree
    naive-bayes.py: the code that implemented naive bayes classifer
    README: this file
    train-set test-set: randomly generated set

How to run: 
    Type "python naive-bayes.py train-set test-set" to run naive bayes classifer algorithm
    Type "python regression-tree.py train-set test-set" to run regression-tree algorithm
    Type "python randomselect.py" to randomly generate training/test set using 10-fold cross validation. 
    It will also call both bayes and regression tree and print out their zero-one loss at different training size.
